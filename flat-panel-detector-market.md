<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion FPDs</li><li>Direct Conversion FPDs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flat panel detector (FPD) market is categorized into two main types: indirect conversion FPDs and direct conversion FPDs. Indirect conversion FPDs utilize a two-step process, where x-rays are first converted to visible light using scintillators, and then the light is converted to an electronic signal. In contrast, direct conversion FPDs convert x-rays directly into electrical signals using amorphous selenium. Each type offers distinct advantages in terms of image quality, sensitivity, and application in medical imaging, enhancing diagnostic capabilities.</p></p>
