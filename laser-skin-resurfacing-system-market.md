<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laser Skin Resurfacing System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ablative Laser</li><li>Nonablative Laser</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Laser Skin Resurfacing System market is primarily divided into two types: ablative and nonablative lasers. Ablative lasers remove the outer layers of skin, promoting collagen production and revealing smoother skin beneath, making them effective for deeper wrinkles and scars. Nonablative lasers, on the other hand, work beneath the skin’s surface without removing its outer layer, stimulating collagen growth with minimal downtime, which makes them suitable for mild wrinkles and overall skin tone improvement.</p></p>
