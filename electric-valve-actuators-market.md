<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Valve Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Straight Stroke Electric Actuators</li><li>Multi-turn Electric Actuators</li><li>Partial Rotary Electric Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric valve actuators are categorized into three main types based on their movement capabilities. Straight stroke electric actuators provide linear motion, typically used for gate and globe valves. Multi-turn electric actuators are designed for valves that require multiple rotations to fully open or close, suitable for applications like butterfly and ball valves. Partial rotary electric actuators, on the other hand, offer a limited rotation, ideal for quarter-turn valves, such as a plug valve or a dampers system, ensuring precise control and efficiency.</p></p>
