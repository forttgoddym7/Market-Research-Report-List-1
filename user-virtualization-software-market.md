<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The User Virtualization Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-persistent VDI</li><li>Persistent VDI</li></ul></p>
<p><p>User virtualization software encompasses two primary market types: non-persistent and persistent Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). Non-persistent VDI provides a temporary desktop environment, where user sessions do not retain customized settings after logout, promoting simpler management and resource efficiency. In contrast, persistent VDI allows users to have a dedicated desktop that retains personal settings, applications, and data across sessions, enabling a tailored experience. Both types cater to different organizational needs and user preferences in desktop management.</p></p>
